  //   // this is happening because component did mount is executed after the initial render, and the initial value of isFetching is false, so when it tries to render CollectionPage it tries to render the collection with an empty store since the initial fetch has not happened yet
  //   // to avoid this we are going to use a different selector for the isLoading property of withSpinner collection page component

  //   // this.unsubscribeFromSnapshot = collectionRef.onSnapshot(snapshot => {
  //   // we change the method onSnapshot that creates the observable and the listener we pass as a function and we use .get() to get the snapshot from the coleection reference object
  //   // .get() makes an API call to fetch back the data asociated with the collection. .get() returns a promise
  //   // collectionRef.get().then(snapshot => {
  //   // this converts the snapshot into an object with the elements we need
